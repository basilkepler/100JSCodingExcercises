there is a course called 100 Python Challenges to Boost Your Python Skills..
this is a udemy course i downloaded from warez-bb.org

i am using the coding excercises ( for python ) given in these course and solve them by writing javascript code.

i will also be maintaining a notebook of - javascript snippets to memorize - as i go through these excercises.
